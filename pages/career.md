We aim to make a huge impact in our industry and foster strong personal growth while doing it.
We challenge each other, we share knowledge, and we believe in the value of difference of opinion.
We are a rapidly growing company with 30+ employees from 9 different nationalities,
and we have three main offices (Oslo, Stockholm, Trondheim).

## We're hiring
<div id="personio-ads"></div>

We believe in transparency, so we've created a page outlining our [interview process](/our-interview-process).
If you would like to join us, please write a bit about yourself and email us at <career@wgtwo.com>.
We take your privacy seriously, so we have created a [privacy page](/privacy) to explain how we treat your data.

## Working at Working Group Two
We're a distributed team, but invest in people getting to know each other across locations.
Every quarter the entire company meets up for two/three days to have fun and to get to know each other better.
Here we find time for events like sledding, skiing, cross-fit, karaoke, you name it!
