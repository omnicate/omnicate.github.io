# Operators

Our primary customers are mobile operators. Our mission is to improve the user experience of their subscribers, as well as making it more affordable and easier to run a core network for the operator.

Our platform includes the functionality of the <b uk-tooltip="title: Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server">HLR/HSS</b>, the <b uk-tooltip="title: Mobile Switching Center">MSC</b>, the <b uk-tooltip="title: Short Message Service Center">SMSC</b> and <b uk-tooltip="title: Multimedia Service Center">MMSC</b> and the <b uk-tooltip="title: Package Data Network Gateway">PGW</b>. In other words, we offer a full mobile core network.

We make the mobile core network programmable for operators, developers and end-users. Our aim is for an eco-system of partners to make  mobile connectivity much more useful. One of the  innovations embedded in the platform is WebRTC. As it is fully integrated into the platform, we enable handovers between GSM and WebRTC end-points seamlessly.

The core network is deployed multi-tenancy from the public cloud. We will usually deploy the packet gateway locally. 

We work with our customers to select and integrate with the host mobile network, as well as interconnectivity, connectivity, roaming, billing and other partners. We deliver the mobile core network as-a-service, and integrate with partners for the remaining services. 

We do not own the end-users, and we do not handle the wholesale capacity agreements. 

Our business model is based on 
- An affordable start-up cost 
- A monthly fee per active user
- Revenue share on additional platform products
