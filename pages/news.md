## Signing our Head of Engineering 
### 4th of December, 2017

We are proud and happy to announce that Daniel Petersson has decided join Working Group Two as our new Head of Engineering. 

Daniel has been working in the software industry for close to twenty years and he has spent the last ten of them working for Google. He has extensive experience in building high-performance, scalable, real-time communication systems, and he also excels at creating strong engineering teams.

In addition to leading the engineering resources in Working Group Two, Daniel will also be responsible for leading our new Stockholm office. Making Stockholm our second hub is a conscious decision as it has a strong reputation for engineering talent in WebRTC, mobile core networks and building scalable infrastructure for global companies.  

For many years, Daniel has used the “Internet way” of solving real-time communication needs. At Working Group Two he will have the opportunity to use many of the same tools, but apply them to the mobile core network layer. This is fully in line of Working Group Two’s ambition of building mobile telecom the “Internet way”.
